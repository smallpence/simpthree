colour picker stupid:
	holding button doesn't show new colour
	picker area bad look at GIMP
	releasing button when off grid does not update colour.
	closing form necessary to change colour
	can't close side panel

zoom bar should have some form of numbers
holding down then coming in doesn't draw

oh yeah it crashed btw
