Basically this isn't usable as a drawing program

-smallest brush size is way too big
-hue of colour that user has selected is not saved so colours end up inconsistent
-no eyedropper tool to at least compensate for this
-no layers
-no undo function or ctrl-z shortcut
-no redo function or ctrl-shift-z shortcut
-slow response times, not helpful if you want to draw smooth lines
-no custom canvas size
-no tablet compatibility
	- pressure pen 

:)
please fix thanks
